This project uses architecture from pyshred (Jan Williams, 2024), which is released under MIT license. 

Pyshred was utilized to reconstruct large atmospheric chemistry datasets from SVD information. The code directory contains the PyShred 
implementation adapted to this dataset. Files derived from the open-source PyShred architecture are not original code. The file svd.py 
contains original code used to compute the SVD of the source data, and shred.py contains original code for training on the processed data.

The results are visualized through the original jupyter notebook file visualizing.ipynb. Visualizations are contained in the folder figures. 
Original data used could not be uploaded due to size constraints.
